# Kaggle-Project---Average-daily-screen-time-of-children
This project analyzes a dataset of children aged 5 to 15 years, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains five key attributes:

Age: Age of the children.
Gender: Categorized as 'Male', 'Female', or 'Other/Prefer not to say'.
Screen Time Type: Defines whether screen time is for 'Educational', 'Recreational', or 'Total' usage.
Day Type: Specifies whether the screen time was recorded on 'Weekdays' or 'Weekends'.
Average Screen Time (hours): The average time children spend on screens.
Sample Size: The total number of children in each category.


Objective:

The goal of this analysis is to:

Identify which age group has the highest screen time.
Determine which gender spends the most time on screens.
Analyze the primary purpose of screen usage (educational vs. recreational).
Assess who is more prone to excessive screen time based on age, gender, and day type.
This study aims to provide valuable insights into children's screen habits, helping to understand patterns and potential areas for improvement in screen time management.
